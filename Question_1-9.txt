1.Which if does the else belong to? Explain why.
if True:
    if False:
        print("A")
    else:
        print("B")
Ans:-The else statement belongs to 2nd if statement because of it follows the indentation of 2nd if.

2.What’s the output? 3explain
def foo():
    print("foo")
    return False
def bar():
    print("bar")
    return True

if foo() and bar():
    print("Hello")
Output:- foo
         bar
Answer:- According to the flow,the foo is called and then bar so the "foo" and "bar" get printed and they constitute an expression which returns false.Hence the if statement       doesn't execute.

3. What happens if you modify the loop variable inside a for loop?
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
    if i == 2:
        i += 1
Answer:- The output doesn't get effected since the i is only the local variable it gets updated on every iteration so any change of i doesn't get reflected.

4. Suppose you have a list of tuples and a set. How would you find all tuples where the first element exists in the set?
Example:  tuples_list = [ (1, "a"), (2, "b"), (3, "c"), (1, "d") ]  
          target_set = {1, 3}  
Answer:-  result=[i for i in tuple_list if i[0] in target_set]
          print(result)         
 
5. Can a set contain tuples that themselves contain mutable elements (like lists)? If not, how can you modify such a tuple to make it hashable and storable in a set?
What happens if you try to create a set like this:
my_set = { (1, [2, 3]) }  
Answer:- Yes, it is possible to store a tuple within a set and list within a tuple.

6. This loop runs infinitely. Why?
x = 1.0
while x != 1.5:
    print(x)
    x += 0.1
Answer:- Because the floating point precision error will show up due to inability of float to store exact decimal point numbers.


7. Convert this loop into a single line using list comprehension:
squares = []
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        squares.append(i ** 2)
Answer:- squares=[i**2 for i in range(10) if i%2==0]

8. Given a nested list l = [1, [2, [3, 4], 5], 6], write code to access and print the number 4.
Answer:- print(l[1][1][1])

9. Given a list of integers, write a function to return a new list containing only the prime numbers from the original list.
Answer:- def prime(orginal):
             result=[]
             for i in original:
                 for j in range(2,int(i**2)+1):
                     if i%j==0:
                         result.append(i)
             return result

10. Given a list l = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], write a program that removes the middle element (or elements if the length is even).

11. Without using slicing ([::-1]) or the reverse() method, reverse the list l = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] using a loop or logic.

12. Write a function to check if a string is a palindrome without using slicing or Python built-ins that reverse strings.

13. Create a 5×5 NumPy array of random integers (1 to 100). Replace all even numbers in the array with 0.

14. Create two 3×3 NumPy arrays with random integers. Write code to check and return a boolean array showing element-wise equality.

15. Given a 2D NumPy array a = np.array([[45, 60], [30, 80]]), replace all values greater than 50 with 100 and calculate the mean of each column.
